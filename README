Installation instructions for facileManager
============================================

This document describes the necessary steps to install facileManager and get it
to a working state - it shouldn't take long at all!

There are two parts: the server and the client(s).  The server is where the web
interface will run from.  It is *not* required to host the MySQL database on the
same server as the web interface.  The client runs on the DNS servers we are
managing.


Prerequisites
--------------

facileManager (server) requires the following:

    * PHP 5.2.0 or later with MySQL support
    * MySQL 4.0 or later
        - Required MySQL user privileges on the database include 
          SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, LOCK TABLES
    * A working webserver (httpd) with mod_rewrite.so enabled
    * facileManager-core

facileManager (client) requires the following:

    * ISC BIND 9.3 or later
    * PHP 5.0 or later
    * A running web server if using http(s) update methods
        - The install script supports the following web servers:
            ~ httpd
            ~ lighttpd


Server Installation
--------------------

1.  Move the contents of the server directory to your document root.
    (ie /var/www/html/facileManager/)
2.  Point your web browser to http://example.com/facileManager/ or your
    virtualhost if you set one up (ie http://facileManager.example.com).
3.  Follow the installation wizard to setup your database.

Additional Steps (OS-based)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ubuntu - Edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/default and change 'AllowOverride 
         None' to 'AllowOverride All' under <directory /var/www/> and reload 
         apache.


Client Installation
--------------------

1.  Move the contents of the client directory to /usr/local/ on your DNS
    servers to manage.
    `sudo mv facileManager/client/facileManager /usr/local/`
2.  Run the following to complete the client installation.
    `sudo php /usr/local/facileManager/fmDNS/dns.php install`
