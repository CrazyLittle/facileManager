Installation instructions for facileManager
============================================

This document describes the necessary steps to install facileManager and get it
to a working state - it shouldn't take long at all!

There are two parts: the server and the client(s).  The server is where the web
interface will run from.  It is *not* required to host the MySQL database on the
same server as the web interface.  The client runs on the DNS servers we are
managing.


Prerequisites
--------------

facileManager (server) requires the following:

    * PHP 5.2.0 or later with MySQL support
    * MySQL 4.0 or later
        - Required MySQL user privileges on the database include 
          SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, LOCK TABLES
    * A working webserver (httpd) with mod_rewrite.so enabled
    * facileManager-core
    * JavaScript enabled in your web browser

fM client requires the following:

    * ISC BIND 9.3 or later (for fmDNS)
    * PHP 5.0 or later
    * A running web server if using http(s) update methods
        - The install script supports the following web servers:
            ~ httpd


Server Installation
--------------------

1.  Move the contents of the server directory to your document root.
    (ie /var/www/html/facileManager/)
2.  Point your web browser to http://example.com/facileManager/ or your
    virtualhost if you set one up (ie http://facileManager.example.com).
3.  Follow the installation wizard to setup your database.

Additional Steps (OS-based)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debian-based/Ubuntu - 
         Edit /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default and change 'AllowOverride 
         None' to 'AllowOverride All' under <directory /var/www/> and reload 
         apache.


Client Installation
--------------------

1.  Move the contents of the client directory to /usr/local/ on your client
    servers to manage.
    `sudo mv facileManager/client/facileManager /usr/local/`
2.  For each module you wish to use, run the following to complete the client
    installation.
    `sudo php /usr/local/facileManager/<module_name>/{dns,fw}.php install`
	


Upgrade instructions for facileManager
=======================================

This section describes the necessary steps to upgrade facileManager and get it
to a working state - it shouldn't take long at all!


Server Upgrade
---------------

1.  Make a backup of your database using the built-in tool via the UI or
    manually.
2.  Make a backup of your config.inc.php file.
3.  Delete your old facileManager files.
4.  Extract/upload the new files from the server directory.
5.  Copy your backup of config.inc.php to the document root.
    (ie /var/www/html/facileManager/)
6.  Login as a super-admin to facileManager and follow the wizard to upgrade 
    your database.
7.  Once fM is upgraded, you will be redirected to the admin-modules page where
    you can upgrade your modules individually.


Client Upgrade
---------------

1.  Make a backup of your config.inc.php file.
2.  Move the contents of the client directory to /usr/local/ on your client
    servers to manage.
    `sudo mv facileManager/client/facileManager /usr/local/`
3.  Restore your backup of config.inc.php to /usr/local/facileManager.

Alternatively, since v1.1, you can update the clients through the UI (servers
page) or by running the following on the clients:

`sudo php /usr/local/facileManager/<module_name>/{dns,fw}.php upgrade`
