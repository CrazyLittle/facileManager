Installation instructions for facileManager
============================================

This document describes the necessary steps to install facileManager and get it to
a working state - it shouldn't take long at all!

There are two parts: the server and the client(s).  The server is where the web
interface will run from.  It is *not* required to host the MySQL database on the
same server as the web interface.  The client runs on the DNS servers we are
managing.
